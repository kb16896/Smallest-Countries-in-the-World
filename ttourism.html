        <p>

            Tuvalu doesn't get a lot of visitors, but it does make a good amount of money off
            of tourism.
            The island isn't made for visitors, so their aren't many real tourist sites.
            If you want to go there, you have to fly into their tiny airport, or find a ship that will take you.
