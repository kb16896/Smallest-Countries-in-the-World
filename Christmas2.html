            As no one has ever returned from their vacation to the north pole having entered it,
            we can't be sure what kind of things are inside.
            We have seen the occasional activity on satalites in the countries single 
            sleighport, especially on Christmas Eve.
            It is not a reccomended to go to the North Pole on vacation.
